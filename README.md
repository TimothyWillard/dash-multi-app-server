# Dash Multi-App Server

It's for just what it sounds like. This is a basic (bare-bones) server that can host multiple dash apps with as little work required by a developer to set it up. To get it setup write a dash application like you normally would, but instead of setting a layout to an app, just place everything into a variable called `layout` and then add a few lines to the config file. To see an example take a look at `app1.py` in the apps folder as well as the config file. Most everything is pretty self explanatory.
